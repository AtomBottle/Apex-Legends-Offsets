Thank to https://github.com/CasualX/apexbot

Usually , I will update the offsets on weekends

If you need the latest offsets

A simple Guide
  Ⅰ
    install rust from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install 
    reboot
    Try to build new solutions and create a new project in vscode
  Ⅱ
    put the "stdafx.cpp" (from https://github.com/CasualX/apexbot)  to the new project
    and compile 
  Ⅲ
    1.Locate the folder .C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Apex
    2.Rename to something else, eg. .EasyAntiCheat_launcher.exeEasyAntiCheat_launcher.exe.bak
    3.Rename to and launch it.r5apex.exeEasyAntiCheat_launcher.exe
    4.To restore functionality simply undo the previous steps.

    Then start the game
    wait for the r5apex.bin .
    it will be in /Your Project/r5apex.bin
    
    put the file to \apexbot-master\offsets
    run "cargo run --release -- "r5apex.bin" ini > stdout.ini" for .int file
        "cargo run --release -- "r5apex.exe" human > stdout.md" for .md file
    wait a second and the .ini file will be in \apexbot-master\offsets\
